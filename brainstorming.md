Evaluation Criteria:

Finance app: 
*Mobile : how unique is the product experience? 
* It is easier for traders on the go to access the markets 
* Real time data 

Story: I enjoy trading as part of my routine for the day and I have used different applications 
and I want to possibly bring the best of all existing applications to one mobile app.
* I believe that it is valuable to any trader and every trader who is always on the move needing to access the markets. 
* My friends and my peers would probably think its a neat idea. 

Market: How large or unique is the market?
* The market is pretty large due to the amount of new traders in the markets now than before.
* I believe it could have value to a lot of people who are interested in the equities market. 

Habit: 
*The average user who is interested in investements would open this everyday.

Scope:
*This application could be implemented in a smaller fashion without all the current modern features of existing applications. 
*It would still be exciting to build out and continue building afterwards and adding features to this application. 
*It is not defined exactly but theres a foundational base of what it should be from the first floor at least. 

Final Idea:
Mobile Finanace Application
